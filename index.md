# Athena Win/Loss Tracker
A single-page web application for tracking and analysing multiple usersâ€™ reported win/loss data
updated across all devices in real-time, using TypeScript, React, React Router, TailwindCSS, Chart.js and Firebase.

In order to improve my web development skills and comfortability, I developed this single-page application as an MVP for a larger project.
In addition to the above, this project was developed using Vite, Jest through the Test-Driven Development approach and then finally deployed using Vercel.

I really had a blast working with Vite and TailwindCSS in this project and will definitely be using this tech stack for more personal projects going forward.
